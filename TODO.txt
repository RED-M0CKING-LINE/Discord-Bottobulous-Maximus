- the bot can respond to file names in spamCog since it is part of message.content apparently
- the bot doesnt stop the command when you say send `mention stop
- the bot does not have a start command. is this needed?
- SpamCog is setup to raise True to the message "sushi" cause it contains "sus" because the condition doesnt seek for "sus " OR "suspicious" OR "sussy"
- make a script that is called by crontab that restarts the bot (just move the crontab command into a script and call it a day)
- store the discord API token in a better way. see how others have stored secrets. add an auto-configuration script to setup the bot
- make the bots status link to the github repo
- Take IDs out and allow special cases to be configurable by cogs (events like on_message, etc)
- rebuild the container i have the bot running in
- add a cog that will ban someone if they play League of Legends for more than 30 minutes
- document which packages will be needed (requirements.txt)
- check for any remaining print() statements
- create a cog that listens for typing indicators from people and announce that they were typing in that chat if they dont send a message after the typing stops.
- create a cog that analyzes a synced memes folder and posts any new memes to the chat, while keeping a hash of memes already sent by it and others, calling out other people who repost memes into the same channel, and to prevent the bot from being a reposter normie
- when the program is sending a lot of messages (ex. with the mention command) they seem to be slightly blocking to the program when the bot is on cooldown from sending messages. this slows down the execution of other commands in the bot, since they are asyncronous in the same thread and the thread will not continue until the message is sent.  
- The bot can ping itself. dont
- The bot can ping other bots. dont
- Integrate the matrix-discord-bridge into my bot as a cog (https://github.com/git-bruh/matrix-discord-bridge). allow it to be configured via discord commands as well.
- add a whitelist for the check to allow some bot users to process commands, such as webhooks made by this bot for the matrix bridge
