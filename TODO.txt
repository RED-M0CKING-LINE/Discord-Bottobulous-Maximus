- the bot can ping itself
- the bot can respond to file names in spamCog since it is part of message.content apparently
- the bot doesnt stop when you say `mention stop
- the bot does not have a start or restart command
- SpamCog is setup to raise True to the message "sushi" cause it contains "sus" because the condition doesnt seek for "sus " OR "suspicious" OR "sussy"
- make a script that is called by crontab that restarts the bot (just move the crontab command into a script and call it a day)
- mention stop stopped working for some reason lol
- replace current deployment method with pulling from github lol
- store the discord API token in a better way. see how others have stored secrets. add an auto-configuration script to setup the bot
- make the bots status link to the github respond
- Take IDs out and allow special cases to be configurable
- Here's an idea, *configuration files*. Who would have thunk it
