## Discord Bottobulous Maximus
-----
## WHY?!?
This is a Discord bot I wrote. It started as a script to spam commands to a Discord bot that made things happen in a friends game to create "challenge mode"
<br>
I then wanted to be able to start it then do other things on my system, so I wrote a bot to add to the server to do that for me.
<br>
Then I added a command where the bot would spam a message a defined amount of times. This was to annoy and cause chaos, which it did. It really should have more restrictions added to it but it is used much more infrequently.


<br>

## Usage:
Execute the `/run.sh` script or run `python3 /src/main.py` on a linux system.
<br>
The `/run.sh` script likely will not work because when I wrote it, I did not think I would be putting this code into the public domain.

<br>

## My Environment:
- I'm using Debian Stable
- CPython 3.9.2 &nbsp; <sup><sub>I tested PyPy but it was roughly 2 times slower.</sup></sub>

If you decide to use this code, I cannot promise that it will work for you under any circumstances. This is just what I am using, and it is working for me. It is very much in early development.

## HELP!!
In the event you need help with something that is specific to this project, have a suggestion, or anything of the sort, please open an issue and/or email me. Since this is a hobby project I do not think too many people will benefit from, I won't be establishing a protocol for creating issues or making contributions. If it becomes popular in the future (which I doubt), then I will reconsider.

## LICENSE:
I was going to say just no license, since this is a hobby project that I made for myself, and I do not mind what others may use any part of this project for, but then I read [this](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) and decided that it would be better that I do choose a license.
<br>
The two licenses I found to pick from was the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) and [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/). Though I admire WTFPL for its short and blunt approach, Unlicense seems like a better choice.
<br>
